# Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP)

This library contains differentiable versions of common DSP functions (such as
synthesizers, waveshapers, and filters) written in tensorflow. This allows these
interpretable elements to be used as part of an deep learning model, especially 
as the output layers for audio generation.
